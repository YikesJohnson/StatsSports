Revisit Stein's paradox using our notes and the Efron/Morris article, found at [https://statweb.stanford.edu/~ckirby/brad/other/Article1977.pdf](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~ckirby/brad/other/Article1977.pdf)

Option 1: two points

In our class notes, we used a slightly abridged version of the $c$ function. Prove that what we did is similar to the one provided by Efron/Morris

Option 2: four points

Use the James-Stein estimator to calculate shrunken field goal percentage estimates. To do so:

- Use field goal attempts in 2005 as the baseline. Only use kickers who kicked at least 30 attempts in that season
- What are the shrunken estimates for these kickers?
- Compare $c$ in the kickers versus the $c$ we observed in hockey players
- Identify which estimates -- either the MLE's (2005 success rates) or the James-Stein estimates were more predictive of those player performances in the future.
