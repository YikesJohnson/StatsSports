## Overview

In this assignment, we will not be using R (but feel free to write up your assignments in Markdown, anyways!)

Read the chapter from [Scorecasting](https://statsbylopez.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/scorecasting_hfa.pdf) on home field advantage in sports and answer the following questions.

1. Explain how the Pitch f/x system is used by the authors to define home advantage in baseball.

2. The authors make use of a natural experiment to test home field advantage in football (although they don't define it as such). Explain this phenomenon in context of their example.

3. Explain why the game's context makes it difficult to judge home court advantage in basketball and home ice advantage in hockey.

4. In no more than three sentences, summarize the psychological explanations the authors give for referee-based home field advantage. 

5. Do you buy the authors argument that referee decision-making is the primary driver of home field advantage in sports? Why or why not?
